# Company Challenge Question:

> Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation challenges us how might we ensure low-income people who mainly live in a cash economy have positive financial health for life? 

# Week of 9/5 to 9/11

## Week Behind

* Each team member developed two set of product sketches for potential ideas to explore (10 product sketches completed in total)
* Completed initial version of company challenge project plan
* Completed initial version of user narratives
* Scheduled research meetings with Prof. Nicola Dell, Cornell Tech professor focused on designing and evaluating systems that improve the lives of underserved populations in low-income regions.
* Scheduled research meetings with subject matter experts that have worked with collecting structured data with low income consumers in emerging markets

## Week Ahead

* Meet with faculty member Nicola Dell on Monday 9/12
* Meet with company champion Dave Kim on Tuesday 9/13
* Draft and agree on development process
* Create progress board
* Develop initial version of architecture diagram

## Risks

* Multiple ideas are being considered and will need advice of company champion to narrow down scope of project
* Need better understanding of customer base to better address the proposed company challenge
* Need to validate the our assumptions about potential target populations with parties mentioned above

# Week of 8/30 to 9/5

## This week we:
   
* discussed the challenge ahead of us, to try to understand: (1) the scope of the problem and (2) our assumptions in relation to the user-base and the system in which the problem exists;
* learned about our team, and the relative strengths of each member;
* reached out to you, and planned a meeting for next week;
* created a system diagram of the challenge ecosystem; 
* defined "wedges", or relative advantages, that might differentiate our products from others on the market; and
* set up the github page for our company challenge "artifacts".

## Next week, we will:

* discuss our challenge with you in greater depth, including: (1) testing our system diagram and wedges with you; (2) testing our assumptions with you, and (3) discussing how better to learn about our target market with you;
* rebuild our system diagram and rethink our wedges in light of our discussions with you;
* do a market study: what are other for-profit and non-profit entities doing in the cash-economy finance space; and
* ascertain what resources might be available to us, and reach out to those resources, especially in respect of consumer research, which may be time intensive and logistically difficult.

## Challenges:

* There is an inherent challenge in working with a non-cash economy, in that we are not certain of the motivations and bounds of the participants in that economy. We run the risk of making incorrect assumptions about the participants if we do not engage in adequate consumer research (or do not analyse a third party's research in that area sufficiently). 
* Financial services, especially consumer services, and especially in relation to the poor, are heavily regulated. As such, we must ensure that our solution falls ourside of, or complies with, any regulation, as well as considers the political sensitivities around the challenge.
* The above will require that, early on in the product lifecycle, we conduct a thorough consumer analysis and regulatory review.
