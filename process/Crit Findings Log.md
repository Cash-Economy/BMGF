## Call with Ryan Falvey, Financial Solutions Lab CFSI
  + "Prize-Linked Savings" are not new and are being implemented by several organizations:
    + CommonWealth (formerly Doorway to Dreams) uses [Save to Win](http://www.savetowin.org/), a lottery based savings incentive scheme operated by local credit unions
    + [Long Game](https://www.longgame.co/index.html), rewards savers with lottery games and prizes to incentivize savings through their app
    + We need to speak to these groups to understand the circumstances under which these incentives are effective
  + Savings groups are already being used to provide formal credit assessment
    + [Mission Asset Fund](http://missionassetfund.org/) has a network of partners who work with savings groups and local credit unions to generate credit scores
    + This could be an important distribution channel for a savings group application
  + Be wary of combining these two ideas and losing the benefits of both. Be clear about your objectives and desired user behavior.
  + The financial health space is already crowded and competitive, but user engagement is still weak for many existing solutions.
  + *Therefore, our efforts will be best channeled towards driving user engagement targeted towards a specific user behavior - saving.*
  + Develop measurement & targets for engagement and user behavior.
