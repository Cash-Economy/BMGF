# Crit Findings Log

*Feedback from conversations with external stakeholders*

## Alumni crit No. 1
- Need to figure out the right incentive. Perhaps we can incent like Oscar Insurance does -- $1 a day (or whatever amt works for us) for a positive balance above a certain amt. Oscar pays $1/day for 10,000 steps walked.

- Don't necessarily need to stick to existing savings groups. We can also use the model to incent people new to the concept to create a savings pool/circle with their friends -- and rely on their ability to hold each other accountable.

- Play with the appropriate incentive if using a lottery system.

- Consider the person in the savings group who has seen our product and like it--we have to provide a mechanism to help them sell this product to their savings group.

- Central product is in user experience.

  + "Prize-Linked Savings" are not new and are being implemented by several organizations:
    + CommonWealth (formerly Doorway to Dreams) uses [Save to Win](http://www.savetowin.org/), a lottery based savings incentive scheme operated by local credit unions
    + [Long Game](https://www.longgame.co/index.html), rewards savers with lottery games and prizes to incentivize savings through their app
    + We need to speak to these groups to understand the circumstances under which these incentives are effective
  + Savings groups are already being used to provide formal credit assessment
    + [Mission Asset Fund](http://missionassetfund.org/) has a network of partners who work with savings groups and local credit unions to generate credit scores
    + This could be an important distribution channel for a savings group application
  + Be wary of combining these two ideas and losing the benefits of both. Be clear about your objectives and desired user behavior.
  + The financial health space is already crowded and competitive, but user engagement is still weak for many existing solutions.
  + *Therefore, our efforts will be best channeled towards driving user engagement targeted towards a specific user behavior - saving.*
  + Develop measurement & targets for engagement and user behavior.

-----

1. Start with what moneydays is right away -- moneydays is a flexible, formalised savings, etc..

2. Who is your audience. The fundamentals of who you're talking to is missing.
	1. Young savers? Or others?
	2. Is fun tone appropriate for your target? 

3. What does savings mean to your audience?
	1. Is it something that rich people do?
	2. Is it something that I'll do when I grow up?
	3. We're changing someone's perception of saving

4. What are friends saving? Do we want this? Kind of foolish
	1. Be sensitive if sharing friends' data

5. Branding perspective: fun tone is not coming through at all.
	1. Keep branding consistent across ppt, demo, tone of messages
	2. Brand = relevant + different + credible
	3. Visual identity = how you look, how you talk, how you feel
	4. Tie user touchpoints back to customer journey
