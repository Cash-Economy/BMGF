# Crit Findings Log

> Feedback from conversations with external stakeholders

## Call with Ryan Falvey, Financial Solutions Lab CFSI
  + "Prize-Linked Savings" are not new and are being implemented by several organizations:
    + CommonWealth (formerly Doorway to Dreams) uses [Save to Win](http://www.savetowin.org/), a lottery based savings incentive scheme operated by local credit unions
    + [Long Game](https://www.longgame.co/index.html), rewards savers with lottery games and prizes to incentivize savings
    + We need to speak to these groups to understand the circumstances under which these incentives are effective
  + Savings groups are already being used to provide formal credit assessment
    + [Mission Asset Fund](http://missionassetfund.org/) has a network of partners who work with savings groups and local credit unions to generate credit scores
    + This could be an important distribution channel for the savings app
  + This space is already crowded and competitive.
  + *Therefore, our efforts will be best channeled towards driving user engagement.*
  + This engagement should be targeted towards a specific user behavior - savings.
  + Develop targets for measuring engagement and user behaviors.
