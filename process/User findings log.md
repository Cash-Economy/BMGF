# Interviews outside of cheque cashing shop

Location | *Manhattan / Chelsea*

## Method and quantitative data

1. The following interviews took place outside of a cheque cashing shop on 8th Avenue.
2. We first asked questions establishing that they would be part of the extended target market for this product.
  Every interviewee fit within the broader target market.
  We acknowledge, however, that we still have to do further consumer research within our narrower user group (persons who are existing users of savings groups). We are working on facilitating these interviews.
  We also acknowledge that we have to do further, in depth interviews with a select few users. It would likely be more helpful to do these with users from our narrower product group.
3. We then asked a few questions establishing the user's relationship with the formal financial sector.
  A significantly higher proportion of interviewees than we expected had little or no trust in the formal financial sector.
4. We then asked about reception of social savings for people who weren't existing users, in order to help determine maximum market size.
  There was generally good reception for social savings. Interestingly, two positive trends emerged:
    - We had a 100% positive response rate to social savings for people who distrusted banks.
    - When asked about participants in a social savings group, each person stated that the people they would include in a savings group would be different from their closest circle of friends. This validates social credit scoring.

## Qualitative data

The below are some interesting details from our interviews.

### Gentleman with a Fleetwood Mac Pin

- Didn't interact with formal financial system any more because of bad experiences, and thefts, associated with a previous identity theft.
- Had access to credit, but paid manually (tangibility?).
- Said he had much more trust in his friends than the bank.

### Gentleman with a Supreme hoodie

- Had never had a bank account, a credit record.
- Thought of a credit record as aspirational.
- Wanted to join the formal financial system, rather than borrow on bad terms from friends / family.

### Lady with daughter in Hello Kitty jumper

- No bank account
- Used cheque cashing shop for remittances (perhaps this functionality should be built into the broader system)
- Did not use social savings in the US

### Older gentleman

- Social distrust of banks (e.g. theories relating to people who "control the banks")
- Cashes cheques at this place, despite the high fees, and saves in cash

### Man holding hands with girlfriend

- No bank account
- However, had a BTC account
