# Mateo And Lucia: Thriving But Still Vulnerable In The U.S.
[*Link*](http://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/house10-ny)

## High level introduction

- Mateo and Lucia (both undocumented immigrants) have relatively high incomes, underpinned by Mateo's work as a mechanic, and supplemented by Lucia's work and various casual work that both of them engage in.
- They use a traditional savings pool (all in, one out), and prioritise this expense.
- Their expenses and financial shocks are usually dealt with by way of (1) cash reserves; (2) access to their savings pool.
- They are liable as guarantor's to a relative's "Coyote" - this puts them in both financial and physical risk.
- Their major economic shocks during the year were (1) lawers fees heaping an expense on them; (2) illness negating their income for a period (also highlighting the risk correlation, rather than risk reduction, for multi-income families and illness -- having another income provider is no replacement for insurance).
- They are partially involved in the non-cash economy:
  - Mateo's primary income is paid into a checking account; and
  - A savings account is linked to the same account.
- However, they primarily save and transact in cash.

## Notes

- Despite their relatively high income, they do not think that they will ever be able to retire.
- Their undocumented status makes them wary of investing in long-term assets.
- Health is a major financial shock to them, due in part to lack of income protection, paid sick leave, and health insurance.
- They do not use any credit facilities.
- Their wariness of the financial sector, and lack of use of formal credit, means that they are not able to establish a formal credit history.
