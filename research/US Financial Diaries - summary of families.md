# 1 Mateo And Lucia: Thriving But Still Vulnerable In The U.S.
[*Link*](http://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/house10-ny)

## High level introduction

- Mateo and Lucia (both undocumented immigrants) have relatively high incomes, underpinned by Mateo's work as a mechanic, and supplemented by Lucia's work and various casual work that both of them engage in.
- They use a traditional savings pool (all in, one out), and prioritise this expense.
- Their expenses and financial shocks are usually dealt with by way of (1) cash reserves; (2) access to their savings pool.
- They are liable as guarantor's to a relative's "Coyote" - this puts them in both financial and physical risk.
- Their major economic shocks during the year were (1) lawers fees heaping an expense on them; (2) illness negating their income for a period (also highlighting the risk correlation, rather than risk reduction, for multi-income families and illness -- having another income provider is no replacement for insurance).
- They are partially involved in the non-cash economy:
  - Mateo's primary income is paid into a checking account; and
  - A savings account is linked to the same account.
- However, they primarily save and transact in cash.

## Notes

- Despite their relatively high income, they do not think that they will ever be able to retire.
- Their undocumented status makes them wary of investing in long-term assets.
- Health is a major financial shock to them, due in part to lack of income protection, paid sick leave, and health insurance.
- They do not use any credit facilities.
- Their wariness of the financial sector, and lack of use of formal credit, means that they are not able to establish a formal credit history.

# 2 Elena Navarro: Getting Through A Tough Year
[*Link*](http://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/house9-ca)

## High level introduction

- Elena is well educated (completed her Bachelors, and considering a JD). 
- She works in mental health, with a steady, high-ish income. However, her job had required her to outlay approximately 15% of her monthly salary in the form of upfront payment for supplies. She wasn't able to keep this going, and quit the job, having a period of unemployment before working on a similar, less well paying job. That job was stressful, so, after another brief period of unemployment, she transferred to an even lesser paying job that she remained at (which paid less than the original job inclusive of the expense outlay).
- She is sophisticated financially, and uses different credit cards for different ends in her day-to day life. Most of these she pays off on time. One of her larger expenses was on a card that she took out for the purpose of that expense, and has a non interest paying period that she is taking advantage of.
- She also regularly takes out familial loans, both explicit from her sister, and implicit, in the form of living without rent.

## Notes

- Her financial sophistication helps her balance financial shocks, but is also a inefficiently used crutch:
  - she sometimes is required to pay overdrafts where she "strategically" paid bills by checque"; &
  - she does not know or understand the interest payments of different cards that she utilises.
- She is held back from pursuing higher income (through further education) by the uncertainty of her present financial position.
- When she has a "good month", she is unable to use it to shore up her financial position because she contributes almost the entire excess to her family, or to pay down the higher interest debts she has.

# <p>Learnings from <i><a href="http://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/house2-oh">The Johnsons: Working Hard But Still Struggling</a></i> <href=>

1. Both Sarah and Sam are earning parents but earn very unpredictable and volatile incomes from part-time jobs
  - they have three kids: Amy (8 y/o), Matthew (20 y/o), Anne (20 y/o)
2. Sarah manages the finances and has a method for covering the recurring expenses, however, the family is completely unprepared for one-time expenses (to do with health, home repair, etc.)
3. Total monthly family income that is needed to meet minimum set of expenses is made up of several sources, as opposed to one or two consistent sources. The sources are:
  - Sam's sales incomes
  - Sarah's full-time income
  - Sam's call center income (part time - very volatile)
  - Sarah's education grant
  - Matthew's scholarship
  - Child support
  - Sam's coaching income (part time)
  - Sarah's secretary income (part-time)
  - other (gifts, help, etc)
4. The family is surviving due to cash injections from family at various points. Sarah's mom loaned $6,000 to the family and does not expect for it to be returned.
5. Currently, the unexpected expenses are covered using credit card debt, and the family also has a mortgage on the house which has not appreciated whatsoever since its purchase.
6. <b>Overall</b>, Johnson's have a negative net worth and a lot of debt (esp credit card debt) that keeps growing with every irregular event. They would not be able to survive without help from family.
