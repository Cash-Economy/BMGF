### Very rough narratives

1. Smoothening income volatility:
  - Individuals have very volatile income streams, and 6 months out of a year individuals either make 20% more or less than their mean income.
  - It becomes difficult to save for the future because the volatility is unpredictable
  - The one predictable one, however, is their tax return (or other government sponsored payments)
  - We will help them smooth out their volatile earnings.
  - One way to do this would be (don't worry about how it'll work legally just yet) to pay an amount to the individual on a monthly basis, and receive the tax refund cheque instead of them at the end of the year.
  - Alternatively, we could receive the tax refund first and pay a portion of it to the individuals.

2. Electronifying savings pools:
  - low income individuals cannot predict negative financial shocks
  - but if in a social contract, they contribute to their social saving pools before anything else out of obligation (place source here)
  - they can pick when they want the liquidity for a small fee
  - their social circle has rules around when one can receive liquidity/how much anyone is allowed to draw at anytime
  - think of it like vacation time at an organization: accrue "ability to draw funds" over time as you put more into the pool.
  - **most importantly** one will always know how much he/she can withdraw from the pool. We can connect individuals who may otherwise not be connected.
