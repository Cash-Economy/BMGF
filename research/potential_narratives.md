### Very rough narratives (KJ)

1. Smoothening income volatility:
  - Individuals have very volatile income streams, and 6 months out of a year individuals either make 20% more or less than their mean income.
  - It becomes difficult to save for the future because the volatility is unpredictable
  - The one predictable one, however, is their tax return (or other government sponsored payments)
  - We will help them smooth out their volatile earnings.
  - One way to do this would be (don't worry about how it'll work legally just yet) to pay an amount to the individual on a monthly basis, and receive the tax refund cheque instead of them at the end of the year.
  - Alternatively, we could receive the tax refund first and pay a portion of it to the individuals.

2. Electronifying savings pools:
  - low income individuals cannot predict negative financial shocks
  - but if in a social contract, they contribute to their social saving pools before anything else out of obligation (place source here)
  - they can pick when they want the liquidity for a small fee
  - their social circle has rules around when one can receive liquidity/how much anyone is allowed to draw at anytime
  - think of it like vacation time at an organization: accrue "ability to draw funds" over time as you put more into the pool.
  - **most importantly** one will always know how much he/she can withdraw from the pool. We can connect individuals who may otherwise not be connected.

# Individual narrative drafts (JCO)

1. 92% of surveyed low income households stated that financial stability is more valuable to them than increased in their income.
2. Income uncertainty complicates choices over jobs, budgeting, taking personal plans, and deciding to borrow or save.
3. Evidence suggest that tools to manage short term income variances lead to major improvements in welfare.
4. The biggest positive cause of variance for the year is *tax refunds*.
6. This is not considered an asset by LMI families, but, rather, as a blip in income during that period.
7. We propose a system which provides value for the asset before the it crystalises -- as an alternate security to asset-based lending.

4. The biggest positive cause of variance for the year is *tax refunds*.
5. We propose to create a service that replaces some credit streams that would traditionally be accessed during negative income variances (e.g. familial credit; pay-day lending; savings groups) with a system that is supported by tax refunds.

When LMI households receive their tax return, they have excess income cf. their expenses. However, it is common that spending increases in those periods, instead of building a buffer. 

Instead, we propose a system akin to pawn-broking or payday lending, except that the collateral is the tax refund instead of tangible assets.

4. Many of these people have managed their credit through savings pools*
5. Savings pools, whilst good stimuli for savings, are inflexible.
6. However, we have found that, on average, each LMI household has 2.6 months a year with income > & < 1 STD DEV of their average income. Therefore, paying the same amount each month is difficult.
7. We propose a system whereby each person is incentivised to maximise their payments each month (to capture more income from the high-income deviations) by making "excess distributions" (which count against their future payment) a "bidding mechanism" for being able to choose their position in the payment flow (to manage the low income deviations).**
8. If the user has a low-income deviation without having the "right" to bid for the next-payment period, the user may request to the group the next payment. If some subset agrees, then the requesting user is given the spot. The erstwile beneficiary is compensated by recieving interest repayments for that month. 

* Savings pools work as follows:
(a) Mario puts $200 a fortnight into a communal money pool with ten of his friends, one of which is trusted to keep records.
(b) Each fortnight, a person is chosen at random, and receives all of the $2000 (although no one person is able to have two rounds of recepts before each person recieves the funds).
(c) These funds are unsecured, and "credit scoring" is done by each person on their peers, based on their friendship and communal trust. 
Note about defaults: in these communities, the contribution to the savings pool, which is to friends and family, is the first payment that a person makes (often before other bills owing) -- the rate of default is "naturally" low.

**the interest accumulated will pay for any administrative costs of holding excess savings (which had not occured before)

9. Each participant is able to pledge some of their "excess" savings (with static total pay requirement), but maintains the status points for choosing their fortnight.

Extras
* Social interfaces (timeline) further incentivise inputs (through staying front of mind and through competition)
* Leaderboards of points, saving and giving do the same.
* Cash inputs are handled with receipts dually signed to an agent, who tfrs the money to account.
* Any user can exit the system at any time upon the payment of a netting amount with a processing fee.
