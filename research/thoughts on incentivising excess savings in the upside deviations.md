1. 92% of surveyed low income households stated that financial stability is more valuable to them than increased in their income.
2. Income uncertainty complicates choices over jobs, budgeting, taking personal plans, and deciding to borrow or save.
3. Evidence suggest that tools to manage short term income variances lead to major improvements in welfare.
4. Many of these people have managed their credit through savings pools* 
5. Savings pools, whilst good stimuli for savings, are inflexible -- requiring the same amount of funds paid into the account each month, and paying out the amount only one per period.
6. Incomes, for LMI Households, however, are not even. Saving the same amount each month is, then, difficult.
7. Research has shown that these deviations are both increases and decreases in income.
8. Increases in income, don't lead to a higher rate of saving.
9. We propose to incentivise savings during these high income deviations, to help cover the lean times.

* Savings pools work as follows:
(a) Mario puts $200 a fortnight into a communal money pool with ten of his friends, one of which is trusted to keep records.
(b) Each fortnight, a person is chosen at random, and receives all of the $2000 (although no one person is able to have two rounds of recepts before each person recieves the funds).
(c) These funds are unsecured, and "credit scoring" is done by each person on their peers, based on their friendship and communal trust. 
Note about defaults: in these communities, the contribution to the savings pool, which is to friends and family, is the first payment that a person makes (often before other bills owing) -- the rate of default is "naturally" low.

7. We want to formalise these savings groups using our app - nisLi:
(a) Like a savings group, each member pledges to pay a certain amount each month for a period of n*freq
(b) However, we capture the upward swings by allowing the prepayment of future payments. These prepayments are held and accrue interest for the group.
(c) Further, we incentivise these savings as with a points / bidding system:
	(i) 	Each dollar committed above par gives the user a point;
	(ii) 	Each month, users bid, with their points, for the right to "order" their payment.
(d) To help smooth shocks, a user who has saved more funds is able to pay less than par untill their payment is equal to par * period.
(e) If a user requires extra funds beyond the payment relief afforded in the above, they can communicate that wish to the group, and that amount can be "pledged" by a user with excess savings, earning the pledgor points. The funds are automatically repaid to the pledgor out of the borrower's "pot".
(f) Further incentive is provided socially, with leaderboards showing how much "extra" each person has saved, and how much has been pledged.
(g) At the end of a period, the interest earned in the group is distributed to the person with the most points.
