emergency savings, according to standard financial literacy curricula

	- <span style = color:red>On average, householdsâ€™ current emergency savings balance was only **22%** of their goal.</color>
	-  the amount of cushion savers have does not increase as incomes rise.

what conventional wisdom recommends, only **7%** of
households had managed to set aside an amount
equal to or more than their perceived need.
