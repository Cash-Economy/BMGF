# Key Learnings

* 92% of surveyed low income households stated that financial stability is more valuable to them than increased in their income.
* Low income households have, on average, 2.5 months a year where their incomes are more than one standard deviation away from their average incomes.
* 18% of households have an income variance of 60-90% of their monthly income.
* Spikes in spending, in 61% of cases, are not correlated with increases in income.
* Income volatility is negatively correlated with income.
* Income sources are covariant.
* The biggest cause of variance for the year is *tax refunds*.
* Income uncertainty:
  > "complicates choices over jobs, budgeting, making appointments and personal plans, and deciding to borrow or save"
* Diversification of labour earning led to decreases in income variance.

> Rather than primarily focusing efforts on long-term savings, for example, the evidence suggest that tools to manage the short term can also lead to major improvements in welfare.

> The findings point to a need for policies to help households better manage liquidity in the short term.
