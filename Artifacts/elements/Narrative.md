> ### How might we formalize informal savings pools to make them more useful for their users?

## How they work

Savings groups are a commonly used tool in cash-based economies for informal savings.
- At frequent intervals, group members make deposits into a community savings pool.
- At the end of each cycle, they receive a lumpsome payment equivalent to the total value invested during that cycle.
- For example, a member's deposit and payout schedule may look like this:

## What are their benefits

Savings groups help members:
- Deal with income shocks by providing income spikes at certain intervals
- Control spending through informal social savings networks
- Complement saving activity with borrowing activity:
