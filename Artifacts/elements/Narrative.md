> ### How might we formalize informal savings pools to make them more useful for their users?

## How they work

Savings groups are a commonly used tool in cash-based economies for informal savings.
- At intervals as frequent as [weekly or daily](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/research/savings-groups-data/frequency-of-deposits.png), group members make deposits into a community savings pool
- At the end of each cycle, they receive a lumpsome payment equivalent to the total value invested during that cycle.
- For example, a typical member's deposit and payout schedule may look like [this](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/research/savings-groups-data/sample-deposit-payout-schedule.png)

## What are their benefits

Savings groups help members:
- Deal with income shocks by providing income spikes at certain intervals
- Control spending through informal social savings networks
- Complement saving activity with [borrowing activity](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/research/savings-groups-data/members-borrow-to-meet-deposit-commitments.png)

## How might formalization increase benefits to users?

Preliminary hypotheses include:
- Increase transparency and control over savings pools
- Enable greater flexibility with payouts
- Coordination of individual cash flow shocks with payout scheduling
- Create a history of payments as a measure of creditworthiness
- Encourage better spending control through increased savings
