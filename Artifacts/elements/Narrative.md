> How might we formalize informal savings pools to make them more useful for their users?

### How they work
Savings groups are a commonly used tool in cash-based economies for informal savings.
- At frequent intervals, group members make deposits into a community savings pool.
- At the end of each cycle, they receive a lumpsome payment equivalent to the total value invested during that cycle.
