## Understanding the Low-income Market

It is important not to make generalizations about low-income populations, as there are significant differences in factors such as employment, education and culture across various markets. However, there are also important commonalities that may help us better understand the *financially excluded* and *financially underserved*.

Key Points:
+ Low-income populations considered are of working age with monthly household incomes in the range of USD 200 - 500.
+ _Financially excluded_ groups do not have any access to traditional banking services, while the _financially underserved_ may have traditional bank accounts yet still lack access to services such as electronic transactions, borrowing or insurance.
+ While education level beyond secondary schooling can be generally quite high, information about the benefits of financial inclusion needs to be communicated more effectively.
+ Basic money management and financial tools are critical to ensuring positive financial health in a modern economy.

Given this understanding, the best way to ensure positive financial health for low-income people is to develop products and services that promote *financial inclusion*.


## Data

One of the primary obstacles to financial inclusion is the lack of reliable, centralized and structured financial data about low-income people. Aggregating and proessing these data can better enable various fucntions of banking and non-banking service providers such as credit scoring, risk assessment and structuring loan and insurance products.

There are several sources of data that may imply spending / saving / sales:
	+	Government (Unique Identification)
	+	Peer-to-peer transactions
	+	Person to Merchant transactions
	+	Aggregated:
		+	Banks
		+	Lenders
		+	Billers
		+	Telcos
		+	Insurance
		+	Assets

> Using non-transactional data (utility payments, cell phone usage, value of assets) to
> assess a user's risk to banks/ insurers/ investors is an important area of opportunity.

Still, complete and official records may be unavailable for those operating in a cash-based economy. Strong social norms around transacting in cash and limited merchant acceptance of digital payments create friction around digitization and collection of data.

> An inventory management tool for small-scale vendors that also allows merchants to track
> customer loyalty can ease the friction of collecting transaction data and creates a “pull”
> for users to digitize financial information.


## Education and Marketing

Another prerequisite to financial inclusion is sufficent education amongst low-income people about its benefits and about the usage of varoious money management and financial tools. 

> Financial health education program - Instructor-based financial education platform to
> educate participants with challenging financial health
> +	Program with classes, speakers, and exercises to help users maintain and
>	sustain positive financial health
> +	Upon completion of program/certificate - a small line of credit will be given
>	to participants to begin building credit history for inclusion into the large
>	banking system
> +	Participants will have a personal tracking mechanism to see the progress that
>	is needed to obtain basic line of credit

General education about financial health will typically be the purview of non-profit organizations, while education around the usage of specific products and services may be carried out as a marketing function of banking and third-party service providers.

> Apprenticeship for financial health
> +	Teaching style → from learning then doing to learning by doing.
> +	Mentors (or bots) guide users to improve real-life financial outcomes
> +	Learn about insurance by being guided through your first insurance purchase, etc.


## Formalization and Brokerage

Savings and insurance may already be practiced informally within community structures. Opportunities exist to both formalize these structures and serve an intermediary function between users, banks and other financial companies.

> Determine optimal use of resources (i.e. cash, land, etc) and suggest investment strategy
> implementable with one click (insurance, forward sales, crop type, etc)
> +	What should I buy to maximise my risk weighted return?
> +	Automate process for purchase, forward sale, insurance all through digital broker

A promising solution may leverage existing social norms such as group savings schemes and community money pooling.

> Interface between community saving pools and banks and financial companies
> + Pooled capital has a lower transaction cost relative to individual accounts
> +	Banks can offer incentives (insurance, loans) for reaching savings milestones


## User Interface

Design and user interface will have a significant impact on the effectiveness and adoption of any product or service seeking to improve financial health. Gamification and 'nudges' are two powerful concepts which may be applied to potential solutions.

> Gamification of financial health encourages positive behavior
> +	Creditometer
> + Visualizing community money pool
>
> Nudges that benchmark users against peers can encourage:
> +	Better spending control
> +	More incentive to save
> +	Opportunity to verify & reflect on daily spending
