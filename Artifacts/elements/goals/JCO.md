My goals for this project:
* better understand the product development cycle
* work with an agile process of iteration and testing
* create a useable product skeths that shows the utility of our idea
* test the product sketch with real users (after internal testing)
* contribute to:
  * the design of the product
  * the legal infrastructure of the product (member-based agreements)
  * the architecture and programming of the product.
* learn as much from the relative advantages of each team member as possible
