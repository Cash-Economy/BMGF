Our wedges fall within the structures of our [System Diagram](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/Artifacts/System%20Diagram.jpg), and should be read in that context. However, for the sake of clarity, our wedges are outlined below:

| 3. **FORMALISING informal structures**: How might we formalise and digitise otherwise informal financial arrangements to make them more effective for their users? | 

1. **DATA**: there does not appear to be an efficient repository of information about participants in the cash economy. By providing a mechanism to report and store data for those participants (both financial and non-financial data), certain issues in relation to credit testing and regulatory compliance (that may otherwise be barriers to entry) can be circumvented.
2. **ED / AD**: there may be an unwillingness by existing financial players to educate the aforementioned participants on financial health, since their per person profitability might be low. However, we see that such education could not only improve financial health, it may also create a potentially profitable market.
