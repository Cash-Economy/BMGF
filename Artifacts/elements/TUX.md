# Entice

An advertising campaign consisting of many split posters in a row with old, and slightly better versions of things, with the moneydays.us logo at the bottom.

e.g.  1992 Corolla and 2015 Corolla
      Dunlop Volleys and Air Jordans
      Baseball Cap and Graduation Cap

(***AAMER TO INSERT LOGO of choice***)

# Enter

We scaffolded (see below ***AAMER TO INSERT***) a set of user onboarding screens that explain our product as well as extract relevant information from the customer.

# Engage

We mocked up a new home / splash screen that has a more deliberate "I opened the app to see this" and call to action (see below ***AAMER TO INSERT both sketch and mockup***).

# Extend

We mocked up a new social / prize screen that gives new surprises as you use the app (e.g. badges) as well as thought of some "get hooked" design details, such as audible interest payments (coin drops for each penny earned), and tickerboard new investment.

# Exit

We consider our withdrawal screen and prize screen to be exit-points, but we hope to restart the loop here. We have not yet completed these.
