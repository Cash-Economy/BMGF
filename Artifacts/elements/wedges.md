Our wedges fall within the structures of our [System Diagram](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/Artifacts/System%20Diagram.jpg), and should be read in that context. However, for the sake of clarity, our wedges are outlined below:

1. *DATA*: there does not appear to be an efficient repository of information about participants in the cash economy. By providing a mechanism to report and store data for those participants (both financial and non-financial data), certain issues in relation to credit testing and regulatory compliance (that may otherwise be barriers to entry) can be circumvented.
2. *ED / AD*: there may be an unwillingness by existing financial players to educate the aforementioned participants on financial health, since their per person profitability might be low. However, we see that such education could not only improve financial health, it may also create a potentially profitable market.
3. *FORMALISING informal structures*: there are exisiting informal financing structures in the cash economy (e.g. savings groups / clubs, "committees", etc.). By working with the finance industry and these groups, we could provide an on-ramp into the formal financial sector by, for example, having the finance industry recognise records in these informal groups as contributory to a credit history.
