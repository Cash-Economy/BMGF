  * Total low-income population in US
  * Freelance workers

## The week ahead

## Key learnings from retro

* Target audience needs to be more clearly defined to strengthen the brand promise of redefining savings
* Rethink "fun" approach - identify the core values that resonate with your audience
* Be sensitive about the financial data shared amongst friends

## Risks

* Not clearly identifying target audience and revising user story accordingly
* Not collecting sufficient feedback from users
