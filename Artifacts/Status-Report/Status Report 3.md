Below is our status report for the week of 9/11 to 9/118. All of the artifacts have been made public and can be found in our [GitHub page](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF)

## Recap on action items from [our conversation](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/research/External%20meeting%20log.md):

@AJTLAU to populate

## Challenge question

> How might we ensure low-income people who mainly live in a cash economy have positive financial health for life?

## The week behind

* After our discussion with you, we shifted our focus from developing countries to participants in the cash economy from the US (the learnings from which may be more widely applicable).
* At your suggestion, we then conducted some research:
  * Each member read a subset of the available US Financial Diaries source material, summarised it and (presented their cases to the team)[https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/research/US%20Financial%20Diaries%20-%20summary%20of%20families.md).
  * As a team, we reflected on the data, and had the following key learnings:

>1.  There is no binary distinction between cash and non-cash economy actors.
>2. Actors who participate primarily in the cash economy tend to have some exposure to the non-cash economy - usually in the form of a chequing account that wages are paid into.
>
>3. Persons appear to be split in the reason for non-participation (or under-participation) in the formal finance sector:
>  * preference against credit (this is a difficult to amend preference); or
>  * lack of financial history; or
>  * other legal reasons.
>
>4. There appear to be two causes of financial instability:
>  * deviation in income   <-- this may be a problem area that can be tackled
>  * deviation in expenses <-- this is difficult to control for, as they are often externalised

  * We [interviewed](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/research/Vox%20Populi.md) people in our market base, to better understand their frictions to market.

* We reiterated on our [product sketches](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/tree/master/Artifacts/elements/product-sketches/post-research) to reflect the above research.
* We came up with a "wedge" that could be a place for us to start with product design and narrative design:

> How might we formalise and digitise otherwise informal financial arrangements to make them more effective for their users.

* We mocked up a first draft product storyboard to reflect the above:
![Storyboard](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/Artifacts/elements/storyboard/Storyboard%20v1.jpg?raw=true "Version 1 of Storyboard")
* We drafted an architecture diagram for the same.

## The week ahead

* We would like to discuss our idea with you broadly, to ensure that development effort is not wasted.
* On Thursday / Friday, we are embarking on our first sprint, and will stand-up a version of the product described in the storyboard above.
* We will continue our paper and personal research into our market sector.

## Key learnings from retro

* It is dangerous to make assumptions about users without properly investegating them (see key learnings from the above).
* Work before our "pivot" to the US translated quite smoothly, validating the idea that learnings from the US would translate back.

## Risks

* After the development work on Thurdsay and Friday, there will be *sunk time* into the idea as formulated above, making us more "sticky" to that idea. We should consciously disregard such stickiness.
