* Conducted user research interviews with restaurant workers in Chelsea - [notes found here](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/research/Vox%20Populi.md)
* Updated [product loop](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/sprint2workbook/Product%20Loop%202016-10-20.pptx) based on new iterations of product
* Built [market sizing model](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/sprint2workbook/Money%20Days%20-%20Market%20Sizing.xlsx) to estimate user acquisition in US and value of savings generated
* Revised frameworks for product development:
  * Updated [technical architecture]() during sprint
  * Developed [pseudocode](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/sprint2workbook/pseudocode%20use-cases.md) for several product use cases to be implemented using Twilio API
  * Identified [data tables and elements](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/sprint2workbook/Database%20tables%20and%20elements.md) for backend database development
  * Identified [methods](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/sprint2workbook/methods_to_build.mdown) required to build working product loop
* Developed `money.days` product prototype:
  * Created stubbed chatbot UI - add `money.days` on Facebook Messenger to try it out
  * Wrote and implemented [code repository](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/tree/master/MoneyDays) for web-based UI with functional back-end integration using Python DJANGO framework
  * Registered domain and deployed code at [moneydays.us](http://www.moneydays.us)

## The week ahead

* Debug code and prepare all elements of UI for user testing
* Conduct to do user smile tests to get reactions to elements of UI and functionality
* Set up focus groups to test full product loop with a savings group
* Continue to follow up on contacts provided by advisors

## Key learnings from retro

* Need speak to potential users and validate product loop and UI elements
* Need to identify captive audiences and develop plan for onboarding new users

## Risks

* If we don't test the product with the users the product might not be viable
* Validation is still needed to ensure product loop is self-reinforcing
