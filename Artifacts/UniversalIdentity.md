Draft of diferent blockchain based universal identity platforms that I've been researched for the moment.

- SolidX:
This seems like a commercial project, you can try a demo.

- ShoCard:
It seems promising but there isn't too much to download for the moment. Is more focus on international travelers issues.

- Blockstack:
Is the most open, and made to integrate with other much bigger systems. They provide all the code and many tools at GitHub.

All the above projects use independents blockchains.

-BitId:
This one, uses the Bitcoin blockchain to prove identity.
It is in a very early stage, and it doesn't have so many options. It's just a demo right now.

Still to check:

Ethereum is working on a Identity implementation. https://blog.oraclize.it/proof-of-identity-on-ethereum-or-the-kyc-problem-f4a9ee40af21#.k1dh5ljhi
