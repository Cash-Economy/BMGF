Our product preliminarily called `money.days`.\r\n\r\n## Our Challenge\r\n\r\n> How might we ensure low-income people who mainly live in a cash economy have positive financial health for life?\t\r\n\r\n## What are we doing?\r\n\r\n92% of low-income households state that financial stability is more valuable to them than higher income. Hundreds of millions of households manage their credit through savings pools. These, however, are inflexible and disconnected from the formal economy. \r\n\r\n*We propose a flexible, formalised savings pool model that builds credit history and generates interest income for the users that is personalised not generic, and fun rather than stressful.*\r\n\r\n[Our latest product demo video](https://vimeo.com/185554227)\r\n\r\n## Our Team\r\n\r\n- [Kuljot Anand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuljot-kj-anand-93925915) | [@kuljotanand](https://github.com/kuljotanand) | CS Candidate\r\n- [Aamer Hassanally](https://in.linkedin.com/in/aamer-hassanally-a067ba27)| [@AHassanally](https://github.com/AHassanally) | MBA Candidate\r\n- [Alan Lau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajtlau) | [@ajtlau](https://github.com/ajtlau) | MBA Candidate\r\n- [Johanan Ottensooser](https://au.linkedin.com/in/jottensooser) | [@oatsandsugar](https://github.com/oatsandsugar) | Tech LLM Candidate\r\n- [Mario Rial](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariorial/en) | [@MarioRial22](https://github.com/MarioRial22) CS Candidate\r\n\r\n## Our [Project Plan](https://docs.google.com/a/cornell.edu/spreadsheets/d/1T09RqzKAFhpwzhwkpHzgbZmC5lsfLfuER64F3gPBU5w/edit?usp=sharing)\r\nSo far, all is going according to plan.\r\n\r\n## Consulted Parties\r\n* Dave Kim | BMGF\r\n* Nicola Dell | Cornell Tech\r\n* Chuck Whitehead | Cornell Tech\r\n\r\n## Want to read more? \r\n\r\nCheck out:\r\n* the products of our first sprint:\r\n  * [the pitch](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/Artifacts/Pitch/Jabberwocky%205.key)\r\n  * [the prototype](https://marvelapp.com/i19c9a)\r\n* our [product storyboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/master/Artifacts/elements/storyboard/Storyboard%20v1.jpg)\r\n* our [architecture diagram](https://vimeo.com/188220559)\r\n* what we are working on [right now](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/issues)\r\n* our [weekly progress log](https://github.com/Cash-Economy/BMGF/blob/master/process/Weekly%20Progress%20Log.md)\r\n",
